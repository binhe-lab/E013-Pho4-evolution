output from PADDLE prediction.

The two CSV files without dates were generated by Yann, who ran the analysis for Lindsey initially. Bin has rerun the analysis, with results saved in `20240305-xxx`. The results had slightly different values, but the overall results are the same. The small numerical differences are likely due to the inputs being non-identical, in particular the secondary structure predictions and the IUPRED2 output.
