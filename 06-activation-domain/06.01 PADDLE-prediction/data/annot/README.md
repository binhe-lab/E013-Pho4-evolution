Diverse Pho4 ortholog annotation.

# 2024-11-01

bHLH boundaries were based on PROSITE PS50888. Note that it differs by one residue position from the Pfam00010 -- for ScPho4, Pfam00010 defines the bHLH as 251-307 while PS50888 defines the bHLH as 250-306. I used the latter in most analyses and in the paper, but when trying to identify the bHLH in the other orthologs, I used hmmscan with the Pfam00010 HMM profile. To be consistent with the PROSITE definition used in other analyses, I manually shifted all the hmmscan identified boundaries by 1 residue.
