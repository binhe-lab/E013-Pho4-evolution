# Goal
In response to one of the reviewers' questions, we would like to test and determine if the activation potential shown by some of the tested regions show Pho2-dependence. Our expectation is that they don't, as most of the regions tested do not contain the Pho2-interaction region from ScPho4.

# Data and Notes
## 2024-11-06
data collected on 2024-10-30 for testing Pho2 dependence of putative activation potential region constructs. a _pho2-_ strain was constructed (yH1009), derived from yH696, which has a Y1H reporter gene expressing mCherry.

Below are Emily's notes on the host strain used in this experiment:

> I redid the transformation of the plasmids that appeared to have no expression the first time. 1009-N (New) is just my way of keeping track of the ones I retransformed. So 1009 and 1009-N are from the same colony just one has been retransformed. 1009-2 is from the second colony that I used from a patch. I haven't done any transformations yet from the strains streaked directly from my independent stocks.

> Anything that just says 1009 were from the first batch. They showed expression the first time I ran them, so they didn't get retransformed
> 
> Except that in this run I had some added plasmids such as Gal 4 full length. They do not have an N because that was the first time I had transformed them, but they were transformed at the same time as the ones marked with N

Bin edited the exported data with the following changes (2024-11-06):

- host strains are renamed as 'NA-host-rep'
- blank wells are renamed as 'NA-blank-rep'
- host strain `1009-N` is renamed as `1009`, but see notes above for differences
- host strain `1009-2` is renamed as `1009a`
