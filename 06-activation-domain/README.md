Compare the activation domain activity between ScPho4 and CgPho4

- 06.01: use PADDLE to predict the activation domain activity in the two orthologs
- 06.02: test the activity of regions with predicted activation potential using a Gal4DBD-fusion construct in a strain with a _GAL1pr-mCherry_ reporter.
