`elife-25157-fig5-data1-v2.xlsx`: contains the meta data for the 100 ChIP-exo binding regions for CgPho4 in _C. glabrata_ genome. Downloaded from the publisher's website for the elife paper [link](https://elifesciences.org/articles/25157)
`elife-25157-fig5-data2-v2.xlsx`: same source as above, contains the list of CgPho4 directly bound and induced genes and the associated expression components from the mutant cycle analysis.
`20161204-curated-CgPho4-binding-regions-in-Cglabrata-genome.fasta`: fasta sequences for the 100 binding regions, manually curated based on the MACS2 fold enrichment estimates and GEMS peak calling.
