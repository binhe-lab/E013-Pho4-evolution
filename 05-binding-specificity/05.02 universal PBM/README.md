# Universal Protein Binding Microarray (uPBM)
The goal of this experiment is to compare the sequence preference of the orthologous Pho4 proteins in _S. cerevisiae_ and _C. glabrata_.

The uPBM was performed following the standard PBM protocol (Zhang et al., 2021, Berger and Bulyk, 2009). An 8x15k array was used to assay all possible 9-mers, from which a robust 7-mer enrichment score can be derived thanks to the high level of replication - each 7-mer occurs on at least 40 probes.
