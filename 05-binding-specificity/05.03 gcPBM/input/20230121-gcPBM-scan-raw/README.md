# Explaning the data
`20230121_cgPho4_yPho4_550_10_1-4.gpr` as an example: 550_10 indicates the scanner parameter, where 550 is presumably the voltage on the detector, and 10 (ms or s?) is the exposure; 1-4 indicates the chamber in the 4 chamber array. See email below for details.

For analysis, the email below suggested the file to use for getting the detrended data.

>  **Due to the difference in signal intensity, I would suggest using files named "550_10" and "550_30" for chambers 1-4 and 2-4, and using "800_80" and "900_90" ones for chamber 3-4, and using "550_5" for chamber 4-4. I have also scanned the array at some other exposure intensities (i.e. 700_70, 600_60, etc.). Please let me know if you need those as well!**

>     Wei is about to do the PBM soon. To process raw image properly, we would need some files from Agilent. Since this design is under your lab’s folder, we have no access to it and cannot download the files. So can you please do it for us and send us the files? These are some instructions:
>
>      If you go to the earray.chem.agilent.com and login, you can find your array under the Microarray tab. Once you’ve located your array, you’ll see a download option under the “Actions” tab (see first screenshot below). After clicking the Download button, a pop-up window will lead you to the second screenshot, where you should select GAL and SEQUENCELIST for download. This usually will give you a compressed file. That would be the one we’d like.
