these are the intensities extracted from the scanned images. the high and low files are imaged at two intensities. An excerpt from the analysis details file (in the `05.02 universal PBM/docs` folder explains the use:

> High intensity scans are often necessary to capture reliable above-background measurements of probes with weaker signals but may result in many bright spots exceeding saturation levels.  Lower intensity scans are consequently required to resolve the relative intensity differences among these brightest spots.  For a pair of scans, Masliner performs a linear regression using the spots that fall within the linear range of the scanner in both scans in order to extrapolate the signal intensities of any saturated spots in the brighter scan.  As output, Masliner returns the GPR file of the brighter scan, with additional columns appended to the end including the adjusted intensity (ADJBSI) of each probe.
