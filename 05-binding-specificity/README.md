the goal of this set of experiments is to compare the binding specificity, that is, the sequence motifs recognized by ScPho4 and CgPho4. We used three approaches: learning the motifs from the ChIP seq peaks (data circa 2011 and 2016); universal PBM; genomic context PBM. The latter two were through collaborations with Raluca Gordan's lab.
