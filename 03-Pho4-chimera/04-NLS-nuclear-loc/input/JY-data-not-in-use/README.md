These are processed ratios from the raw ImageJ quantifications. See RDSS for the Excel files used for obtaining these ratios. The tsv files in the parent folder are the raw files and should be used for the analyses.

In the 020624 (PHO2), 021524 and 021624 (both _pho2-_) experiments, a non-fluorescent sample was also imaged and the average intensity was subtracted from the fluorescent samples to correct for auto-fluorescence.
