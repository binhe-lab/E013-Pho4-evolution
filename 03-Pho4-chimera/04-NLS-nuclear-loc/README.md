We originally designed the breakpoints so that region 3 corresponds to the NLS/NES. Later we found out that in CgPho4, the second half of region 3 overlaps with E2_9aa, the second Activation Enhancer Region. Since region 3 showed the strongest positive effect on A<sub>PHO2</sub>, we would like to determine if the effect is due to enhanced nuclear localization or enhanced activation. To test the former, Lindsey picked a few chimeras with region 3 from either ScPho4 or CgPho4, as well as the two endogenous Pho4. Jinye performed fluorescence microscopy and quantified the nuclear vs cytoplasmic GFP signal intensity (integrated) in ImageJ. She did so with the strain genotype blinded. The data is in the input folder. An R notebook is in the analysis folder, containing plots and statistical analyses.
